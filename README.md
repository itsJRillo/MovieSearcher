# SHOTEN - Movie and Series Catalog

Welcome to SHOTEN, a platform where you can browse and save your favorite movies and series. This project was developed during my free time this summer to test my skills.

I built this platform using React as the primary framework and TypeScript instead of JavaScript to apply what I learned during the summer.

Apart from the website I also added some e2e testing with Cypress, I used my knowledge with Cypress that I learnt on my previous intership into the deployment of the website, using the plugin-cypress that Netlify offers I was able to integrate e2e tests on deploy, here are some screenshots:

With this I can unsure that the website will function properly and all the components will load with this aditional layer of security.
